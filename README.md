# Vite based project

We will implement Vite in a new project with good practices, last node version, features, etc.

Will use:
- Node 20 🚀
- React 💻
- JSDoc 📒
- GitHub Actions 🤖

We choose not use TypeScript and JSDoc instead, to avoid the compilying phease, improve the developer experience, still have all the benefits from typing, no configurations, dependencies, etc. 

The idea of NOT using prettier, ESLint and webhooks locally is to give a better developer experience. This tasks will be handled in the repository trought GitHub Actions.
